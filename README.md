## GIPEDI Weekly Meet 8
#### July 2, 2021
Prof Subrat Kar explained the importance of silence and encouraged the interns to go for higher education and shared some information on M.Tech, MS and PhD programmes offered in India and abroad.

## GIPEDI One-to-one Interaction with Mr Suprovat Gosh
#### July 6, 2021
Mr Gosh shared materials to explain how abstracts for a conference paper is composed. He further suggested me to replace Copper with Gold in my simulated metamaterial structure.  

## Metamaterial Project Progress
After replacing Copper with Gold in the metamaterial design, the simulation failed every time. I informed Mr Gosh about this and he suggested me to reduce the air-box dimensions. Yet, the problem persisted. So I again used Copper and designed the spiral square ring slot and observed the absorbance output.


#### 1. Replacing concentric square ring slots with Spiral square ring slot:

#### 2. Rotating the Spiral Square ring slot by 45 degree:

### Inference:
From the above observations, the following has been infered:
   1. Upon replacing the concentric ring slots with spiral ring slots, the number of absorption bands increased and the peak absorbtivity of the bands in frequency range 75 - 80 GHz, got enhanced.
   2. Upon rotating the spiral square ring slot by 45 degree, the the peak absorbtivity of the bands in frequency range 83 - 90 GHz, got enhanced and a wider absorption band in frequency range 97 - 101 GHz was obtained.  

### Conclusion
- Using spiral Slot in place of concentric ring slots yields broader absorption band since the former offers higher electrical length.
- The high absorptivity over multiple frequency bands can be achieved by rotating the spiral ring slot.

### Future Work
The designed metamaterial structure should yield wider absorption band if the sharp edges of the spiral slot be replaced with curved edges due to higher Stepped Impedance Resonance (SIR) of the latter [1].
